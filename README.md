# Summary
<p align="left" style="font-family: Georgia; font-size: small; color: #1e81b0">
A program to record and predict cell motion responding to biological and mechanical stimulation. Utilizing the libraries of pysimplegui, opencv and scikit-learn, this program features a graphical user-interface which allows the user to track the number, size, and location of cells within any given image or video taken of cells with a microscope. Can be used to track and visualize useful statistics about the cell cultures in response to biological and mechanical stimulation.

# Instructions for Use:
## Conda

[Conda](https://docs.conda.io) is an open-source package management system and environment management system.
We will use Conda to help us create and manage a Python environment with the specific packages needed for this project.

## Installation

We will use a minimal installer for Conda called [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html).
Follow the instructions below for your operating system.
Note that in all cases, we will be using Python 3.x, _not_ Python 2.7, so make sure you are downloading and installing the correct version of Conda/Miniconda.

### Windows

This section assumes you are installing Conda using a Windows installer for use with the traditional Windows command prompt.
If you are using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl) (WSL), use the Linux instructions instead.

1.  Download the [latest version](https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Windows-x86_64.exe) of Miniconda from the [Windows installer section](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers) of the Miniconda website

2.  [Install Miniconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html), and configure it with the following options if prompted:

    - Yes, add to path

    - No, do not make the system's default Python

    - Yes, create Start menu entries

3.  Verify that your install works as expected using the testing steps described in the [Miniconda installation instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/windows.html)

### Linux

Some distributions package Miniconda; try searching for `conda` or `miniconda` with your system package manager (e.g., `apt`, `dnf`).
For example, on recent versions of Fedora, you can run `dnf install conda` to install Conda.
Note that these packaged versions may be somewhat out of date, however, that is usually not an issue in day-to-day use unless you are reliant on bleeding-edge features of the `conda` executable itself.

If not available in your system package manager out of the box, you can also add [repositories for RPM- and Debian-based distributions](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/rpm-debian.html), and then install Conda using your system package manager.

In all other cases, follow the [Linux installation instructions](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/linux.html) on the Conda website.

## Environment Setup

Once you have Conda installed, you will need to set up a Conda environment that contains Python itself and all of the supporting packages we'll be using in the project.
Once the environment is created, you will simply activate it and set it as the default interpreter.
To create your Conda environment, complete the following steps:

1. Open a new command-line shell

    - On Windows: run the "Anaconda Prompt" application from the Start menu

2. In your shell, change directory to the location where you are storing this project
   ```cd C:\your\path\```

3. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```git clone https://github.com/Zeathary/cell-analyzer.git```

4. Change directory to the newly-cloned `cell-analyzer` directory

5. Create the `cell_analyzer_env` Conda environment:

    ```conda env create -f env_setup.yml```

6. Once the environment is created, activate it:

    ```conda activate cell_analyzer_env```

7. Change your Interpreter in Pycharm (Optional):
   - File > Settings > Project:cell-analyzer > Python Interpreter > Add > Conda Environment > Existing Environment > 
   - ```Interpreter: C:\Users\yourname\miniconda3\envs\cell_analyzer_env\python.exe```
8. Run cell-analyzer.py

If all works as expected, the script will run correctly. If any of the packages report an error, verify that you have first activated the correct Conda environment.

Note: An executable can be made on Windows machines by running prototype/create_cell_analyzer_exe.ps1 within powershell with PyInstaller installed
